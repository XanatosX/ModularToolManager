# Scope of a setting

Settings for plugins can have different scopes. Those scopes do define where you can change the value. Right now there are only two scopes, which are listed below. This could increase later on.

## Global

The setting can be set on a global scope. Those settings can be set in the `help->plugins` window. You will find a settings tab there for each plugin.

The setting will be applied for each function using this execution logic.

## Function

The setting can also be set on a per function level. This scope will always override the state set by the global scope.
