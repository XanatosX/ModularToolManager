# Languages

The application does come with two languages right now. The default one will be detected on application start based on your system localization.

You can still change the language by going to `File -> Language`

Right now the following language are supported

- English
- German

If you want to improve the translation use this [link](https://crowdin.com/project/modular-tool-manager) to Crowdin. If you want to add an addition language, please create an issue I will inform you as soon as you can start translating via Crowdin.
